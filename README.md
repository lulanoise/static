# Exercise: static
* define a class `Employee` with:
  * 3 instance variables `name`, `surname` and `address`
  * a constructor method that assigns 3 params (`newEmployeeName`, `newEmployeeSurname`, `newEmployeeAddress`) to the respective object's properties
  * a method `getEmployeeDetails()` that returns an informative `String` with all the details of the `Employee`
* define a class `Badge` with:
  * a `private static int` variable called `totalNumberOfEmployees` (the value of this variable will be shared across multiple class instances)
  * a `private String` variable called `badgeIdCode`
  * a `public Employee` variable called `employee`
  * a `private static void` method called `keepTrackOfEmployeesNumber()` that increments by 1 the `totalNumberOfEmployees`
  * a `private String` method called `generateBadgeIdCode()` that returns a `String` containing `name` and `surname` of the employee between two random `String` codes (e.g. `XYZNameSurnameZYX`)
  * a `public void` method called `showBadgeDetails()` that informs the user about:
    * the total number of employee tracked by the badges
    * the details of the employee
    * the `badgeIdCode`
  * a constructor method that takes an `Employee` param called `employeeThatNeedsBadge` and:
    * call the `static` method for keeping track of the number of employees
    * assign the value of `employeeThatNeedsBadge` to the object's `employee` property
    * assign a generated id code to the object's `badgeIdCode`
* define a tester class where you:
  * create 2 new `Employee` objects
  * create their new 2 `Badge`
  * show to the user the 2 employees' badge details
